Hello! Welcome to Waffltron's Repo!
I sometimes put stuff on this Repo, mostly little experiments and collections of info I feel like putting out on the internet.
This can be a database. It's linux focused, so I won't usually release stuff for Mac or Windows, but I will work with people who fork my stuff to make it part of this repo so anyone can enjoy ports and versions of my stuff.
If you want to collab, just reach out to me!
Good day, everyone! :D
